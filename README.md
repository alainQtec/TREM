I've used many debloating scripts, but I always ended up editing them to suit my
needs.

This is an attempt to make the best of all of them as a PowerShell module.

## Usage

```PowerShell
Install-Module TREM
```

then

```PowerShell
Import-Module TREM
# start the bl🤬at RemOVAL!
Remove-Bloat -c ads, network -Force
```
